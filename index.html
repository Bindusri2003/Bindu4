        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            Hard-working, creative and proactive.I am thrilled to introduce myself as a passionate and motivated 
            with a strong foundation in Python, Java, C, and HTML&CSS. As a recent graduate in electronics and communication,
            I have honed my programming skills and developed a keen interest in creating innovative solutions using 
            these versatile technologies.
            C has taught me the importance of low-level programming and memory management, while is good for writing codes.
            Java has been another significant part of my learning experience, and I am fascinated by its object-oriented paradigm.
            Alongside these programming skills, I have also dabbled in HTML, which forms the backbone of web development.
            Understanding HTML's structure has allowed me to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages.

            <h3>Smart and Safety Helmet for Bike riders</h3>
            
            <p>
                In today,s fast paced life most of accidents happen due to drinking and driving. Most of the countries are
                forcing the motorists to wear a helmet, however rules are being violated by uncivilized citizens. In present
                day scenario we encounter numerous cases of death due to twowheelersroad accidents. The main reason being
                severe head injuries. Despite of the fact thathelmets are available everywhere, people are not wearing them. 
                That the objective of this project is to make sure people wear helmets and then ride bikes. Another objective
                isto makesure the rider isn't drunk. The rider won't be able to ride the bike if he is drunk. One more objective
                is to reduce the fatality of the accidents by sending a message to the rider's relativeabout the accident. To 
                make sure that people do not ride at illegal speeds, and to inform thetraffic authorities in case of breaking
                the rules.A safety system has been embedded inside the “Smart Helmet” where a circuit will be placed 
                inside the helmet, without wearing which the bike will not start. An alcohol level detector is 
                also present in the circuitry.

            <h3>SIMPLE-CALCULATOR</h3>
            <p>
                The calculator project is a simple yet essential software application that allows 
                users to perform basic arithmetic operations and more complex calculations quickly and efficiently. 
                The calculator provides a user-friendly interface where users can input mathematical 
                expressions and obtain accurate results in real-time.I have used HTML,CSS and JS to built this project.
